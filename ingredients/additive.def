Raspberry: Adds raspberry flavors, but since the yeast eats all the sugar, it ends up making the beer more sour.
Blueberry: Adds blueberry flavors and sourness.
Coffee: Works well in darker beers, like stout and porter but also brown ale.
Habanero: Adds a chilly punch to the beer. To reduce the punch, remove the seeds before adding it to the boil.
Lime: Adds a fresh lime taste. Nice in summer ales.
