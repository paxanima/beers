My second batch and an attempt at making a dry, smoked porter. I split the batch in two to try out the effect of yeast in a beer: one with @yeast(WLP007) and one with @yeast(WLP013). To try out flavorings even more, I added blue berries to a part of the WLP013 batch and coffee (cold brewed with 2.5dl water and 50g coffee) to the WLP007 one.

## Taste

The @yeast(WLP013) was the best one and more to my liking, with a smoky taste and dry finish. The one with the blueberries was quite sour during bottleing, but was less sour after a couple of weeks on the bottle. The blueberries went suprisingly well with the porter. 

## Improvements

Add some more caramel malts
