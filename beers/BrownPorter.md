Additives:

A very classic porter, with a good dose of brown malt to make it closer to a brown ale than a stout. Nice and coffee like tones to it, with the brown malt adding the nuttines. A version with coffee added was also made, using 100g coffee to make cold brew that was adding during bottling. The coffee didn't turn out as strong as expected, so it was not too noticeable.
