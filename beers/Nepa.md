Label: NEPA
Additives:

An attempt at making a NEPA, with a lot of hops added towards the end. I omitted the flaked oats (or wheat), which normally is added to make it more hazy, but added all hops in the last 5 minutes of the boild for lots of hoppy aroma, plus dry hopping before the primary fermentation and after. The result was a super hoppy and nice pale ale.
