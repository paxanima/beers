This turned out to be a hot saison, but not too hot. I had never used habanero in anything before, and it was an interesting experience to feel the burn on my fingers from chopping it and the prickling sensation in my forhead from the fumes once added to the boild. The result was very good, and a favorite among those who tried it. The kick from the habanero was a nice finish to a light and tasty saison.
