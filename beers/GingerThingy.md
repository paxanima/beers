My first ginger beer experiment proved a succes (I guess I'm lucky), hitting just the spot with the ginger taste and the ginger bite. The munich malt gave a nice biscuity, malty backbone to the ginger. I also tried with @yeast(WLP011) using the same wort, which was very interesting. In the description of the yeast on the homepage, it says it contributes to a malty character, which was very true. A bit too true, since it made the malts stand out too much, concealing the ginger taste. The @yeast(WLP013), however, was just perfect.
