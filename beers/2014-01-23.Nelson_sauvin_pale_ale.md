My first beer ever made: a single hop Nelson sauvin pale ale. Being the first beer, I also made a lot of mistakes, making the beer stronger and more bitter than planned... From the same wort I also had one with belgian yeast @beer(Belgian Pale Ale).

## Taste

Nice and tropical, but strong and bitter. Not too bad for a first attempt.
